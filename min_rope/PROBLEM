A number of ropes are given with length L1,L2,L3, ... , LN.
Cost of tying two ropes is the sum of their lenghts.
At a time only two ropes can be tied together.
Find the most cost effective solution.

eg:
L1=1
L2=2
L3=3


1+2=3       3
3+3=6       6
Total =     9

1+3=4       4
4+2=5       9
Total =     13

2+3=5       5
1+5=6       6

Total =     11

Hence the solution is 1,2,3
